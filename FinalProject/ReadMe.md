This is an iOS mobile app project built with Swift and the XCode IDE.

It is called Angels and it is based off the master thesis of Trina West entitled "Angels: The Games We Play."

This app is fully functional with some of the design elements implemented. In the future I will build a much more sophisticated UI/UX experience as well as multiplayer functionality.
